This package provides a simple method of creating Elasticsearch indexes for
Django models.

-----

Versions
--------

Branch :code:`master` targets both Elasticsearch 2.x and 5.x and will receive new
features. Both `elasticsearch-py` 2.x and 5.x Python modules are currently
supported. `Documentation <http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io/>`_

Branch :code:`1.x` is the maintenance branch for the legacy 0.9.x versioned releases,
which targeted Elasticsearch versions less than 2.0. This branch is unlikely to
receive new features, but will receive required fixes.
`Documentation <http://django-simple-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/>`_

**Using a version older than 0.9.0? Please be aware that as of v0.9.0, this package
has changed in a backwards-incompatible manner. Version 0.5 is deprecated and no
longer maintained.**
